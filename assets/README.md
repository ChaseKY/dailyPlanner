# dailyPlanner
This daily planner was created to help keep track of your daily work schedule while alerting you of the current time and events to come later in the day. It includes the month, day, and year on the top of the page. It also includes a feature that changes the color of the text boxes for each hour depending on if they represent the current hour, past hours, or future hours.
